One of the most popular and important characteristic of a complex network is community structure. Detecting communities
has been an area of interest for researchers to find an optimized algorithm and optimize that further. In this report we propose a technique to find overlapping community structures in a network/graph using seed set expansion technique. Like any other seed set expansion technique our algorithm also has two phases â€“ finding a set of good seeds and expanding the initial seed set to form a community. Specifically, we find a set of good seeds based on the degree of connectivity of a
node within a graph and then recursively grow the seed sets until all the nodes are exhausted or no more growth or improvement is possible. The basic feature of this algorithm is its simplicity and at each iteration, it tries to grow the community and at the same time tries to improves the quality of the community as well. We also show the effectiveness of this algorithm in finding communities, using experimental results.
